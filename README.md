- Webhooks at Stripe listen for customer, subscription, and payment events
- SHA-256 hash verification ensures data integrity and authenticity
- Strategies dynamically select the class to handle payloads based on event type
- Queueable Apex for asynchronous callouts and processing  
- Finalizer implementation with 5 automatic retries on failure  
- Error handling and logging via Nebula Logger 
- Nightly batch sync job to reconcile payment data

Nightly Sync:

- Automated nightly execution using Schedulable Apex
- Batch Apex processing for bulk updates of customer payment data
- Retrieves new and updated accounts from Salesforce for processing
- Callouts to Stripe to fetch the latest customer and payment information
- Updates Salesforce records with accurate Stripe data
- Configurable via Named Credentials for secure API authentication
- Easily scheduled and managed from Salesforce Setup 

## Setup Instructions

### 1. 🏋️‍♀️ Prerequisites
- Salesforce org with API access enabled

- A valid Stripe API Key (test or live, depending on environment)

>[Stripe API References](https://docs.stripe.com/api)

>[Stripe API Keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys)

>[Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/dashboard)

- Stripe Webhook setup required to receive events (e.g. customer.updated, invoice.paid, etc.)

- Webhook secret used for SHA-256 hash verification


### 2. 🛠️ Installation
   1. Clone or pull this repository into your local Salesforce DX / VS Code project  
   2. Deploy metadata to your Salesforce org  
      ```sh
      sfdx force:source:deploy -p force-app

### 3. 🤓 Configuration
   1. Named Credential/ External Credential Permissions
   Configure with your Stripe API key / secret by replacing "INSERT BEARER + YOUR KEY HERE" with your own (do not commit this to source control).

   2. Stripe Webhook Setting (custom metadata)
   Add a new Stripe Webhook Setting with the webhook secret from Stripe

## 🐎 Usage

Once installed and configured, the integration runs automatically:

### Outbound (Salesforce → Stripe)
1. Create or update a record in Salesforce (e.g., Customer or Subscription).
2. The **Trigger** fires, passing the record into the **Handler**.
3. The **Handler** determines if a Stripe sync is required.
4. The **Service Class** prepares the request payload for Stripe.
5. A **Queueable Apex** job is enqueued to make the asynchronous callout.
6. Stripe processes the request and returns a response.

### Inbound (Stripe → Salesforce)
1. Stripe sends an event (e.g., `invoice.payment_failed`, `customer.updated`) to the configured Salesforce **Webhook endpoint**.
2. The **Webhook Controller** receives and validates the request.
3. A **Queueable Apex** job is enqueued to process the webhook event asynchronously.
4. Salesforce records are updated to reflect the latest state from Stripe.

### Example Flow
- **Salesforce user** creates/updates a subscription record → Trigger → Handler → Service → Queueable → Stripe.  
- **Stripe** notifies Salesforce of a change → Webhook → Queueable → Salesforce updates record.


## 🥴 Troubleshooting

   1. Verify Object and Field Level Security

>[Object Permissions](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.securityImplGuide.meta/securityImplGuide/users_profiles_object_perms.htm)

   2. Confirm Sharing Settings allow access

   3. Double-check Stripe API Key and External Credential configuration
